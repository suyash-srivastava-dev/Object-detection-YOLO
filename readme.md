## Key Terms

- **Stochastic gradient descent** is an iterative learning algorithm that uses a training dataset to update a model.
- The **batch size** is a hyperparameter of gradient descent that controls the number of training samples to work through before the modelâ€™s internal parameters are updated.
- The **number of epochs** is a hyperparameter of gradient descent that controls the number of complete passes through the training dataset.
